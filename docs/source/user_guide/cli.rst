Command Line Interface
----------------------

GAMA may also be called from a terminal, but the tool currently supports only part of all Python functionality.
In particular it can only load data from `.arff` files and AutoML pipeline configuration is not available.
The tool will produce a single pickled scikit-learn model (by default named 'gama_model.pkl').
Please see `gama -h` for all options.
